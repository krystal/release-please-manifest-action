A composite action which wraps [release-please-action][] and
[github-app-token][] actions, with opinionated default settings focused on
running [release-please][] in [manifest mode][].

_Note: This is a fork of
[`jimeh/release-please-manifest-action`](https://github.com/jimeh/release-please-manifest-action),
customized by [@krystal](https://github.com/krystal) for their own needs.
Upstream changes will be included as appropriate._

[release-please-action]:
  https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action
[github-app-token]: https://github.com/tibdex/github-app-token
[release-please]: https://github.com/googleapis/release-please
[manifest mode]:
  https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/blob/main/docs/manifest-releaser.md

# Features

- Focuses on and only supports running release-please's manifest command.
- Optionally supports having release-please authenticate as a GitHub App.
- Defaults to looking for release-please's config and manifest files within the
  top-level `.github` directory instead of in the repository root.

# Examples

All examples assume you have placed your `release-please-config.json` and
`.release-please-manifest.json` within the `.github` directory in the root of
the repository.

See release-please's [manifest-releaser][manifest mode] documentation for
details about the config and manifest files.

## Basic (Actions Token)

This example will have release-please authenticate using `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`
that is automatically available to all actions.

This will prevent checks / GitHub Actions running against any Release Pull
Requests raised by release-please. This is a feature of GitHub as a means of
trying to avoid GitHub Actions jobs triggering themselves, causing an endless
loop.

If you need checks to run against Release Pull Requests, you will need to have
release-please authenticate with a Personal Access Token (PAT), or as a GitHub
App.

<!-- x-release-please-start-major -->

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: krystal/release-please-manifest-action@v1
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

<details>
<summary>The above is equivalent to:</summary>

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        id: release-please
        with:
          command: manifest
          config-file: .github/release-please-config.json
          manifest-file: .github/.release-please-manifest.json
```

_Note: Outputs are not included in this equivalence example._

</details>

## Personal Access Token (PAT) Authentication

This example will have release-please authenticate with a user's Personal Access
Token (PAT), performing all operations on behalf of that user. Allowing checks /
GitHub Actions to run against Release Pull Requests.

It is common to have a dedicated "bot" user created for these purposes. But
within paid organizations, that means an extra user seat needs to be paid for.
In that case you might prefer using a GitHub App instead.

<!-- x-release-please-start-major -->

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: krystal/release-please-manifest-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_PAT_TOKEN }}
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

<details>
<summary>The above is equivalent to:</summary>

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        id: release-please
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_PAT_TOKEN }}
          command: manifest
          config-file: .github/release-please-config.json
          manifest-file: .github/.release-please-manifest.json
```

_Note: Outputs are not included in this equivalence example._

## GitHub App Authentication

This example will have release-please authenticate as a GitHub App, performing
all operations on behalf of the app.

This has a few benefits compared to using the token provided by GitHub Actions
or a user's personal access token:

- It allows checks / GitHub Actions to run against the Release Pull Requests
  raised by release-please.
- An app can be given permissions to access all repos within an organization.
- Compared to creating a separate "bot" user, paid organizations do not need to
  pay for an extra user seat when using an app.

Below we assume you have already setup `RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID` and
`RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets in the repository or organization.

To set the private key secret, it is easiest to base64 encode the contents of
the `*.pem` file you get from the GitHub App's configuration page. The base64
encoded string should not have any line-breaks.

<!-- x-release-please-start-major -->

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: krystal/release-please-manifest-action@v1
        with:
          app-id: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

<details>
<summary>The above is equivalent to:</summary>

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: tibdex/github-app-token@v1
        id: github-app-token
        with:
          app_id: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_BOT_APP_ID }}
          private_key: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v3
        id: release-please
        with:
          token: ${{ steps.github-app-token.outputs.token }}
          command: manifest
          config-file: .github/release-please-config.json
          manifest-file: .github/.release-please-manifest.json
